# ðŸ–– MakeItSo: Simple & Reliable File Management for .NET, Inspired by Star Trek LCARS

## What is MakeItSo?

**MakeItSo** helps you safely create, organize, and track files and logs in your .NET applications. Inspired by Star Trek's LCARS computer system, it makes file engagement easy, reliable, and even funâ€”**engaging maximum warp** for your development workflow.

## Why Use MakeItSo?

- **Red Alert: No More Lost Files!**  
  Uses a proven "ADD/DEL" safeguard to make sure your files and logs are never accidentally deleted or overwrittenâ€”your data is **safe at warp speed**.

- **Easy Tracking with **Stellar** Navigation**  
  Automatically creates organized files and log entries, so you can always see what happened and whenâ€”like having **Data** manage your file systems.

- **Beautiful Reports from the **Bridge****  
  Gives you simple and colorful health checks, showing if your files and logs are safe and workingâ€”just like Star Trek's **LCARS computer screens**.

- **Plug & Play **Universal Translator****  
  Works with regular files, cloud storage (like Azure or AWS), and even databases (like SQLite)â€”all with the same easy setup across the **galaxy**.

- **Custom Suffix Workflows: **Prime Directive** Flexibility**  
  Go beyond just "_add" and "_del"â€”define your own file suffixes and workflows (such as "_archive", "_backup", "_error", and more) to fit your **mission parameters**.

## How Does It Make Life Simpler?

- **Just Add a Line: **One to Beam Up****  
  With one line of code, you get safe file creation and loggingâ€”**energize!**
- **Automatic Safety: **Shields Up****  
  Prevents mistakes when multiple users or programs access your files at the same timeâ€”**deflector shields** for your data.
- **Instant Status: **Tricorder** Readings**  
  Run a check and instantly see if everything is OKâ€”no more digging through folders or error logs. **"Fascinating, Captain."**
- **Flexible: **Holodeck** Versatility**  
  Track work, app events, or logsâ€”whatever you need! **Computer, arch.**
- **Custom Workflows: **Replicator** Technology**  
  Set up new suffixes and actions for your files, so your workflow matches exactly what your **crew** needs.

## Example: Logging an Event (**Captain's Log**)

```csharp
await lcars.WriteAsync("logs", "User signed in");
// This safely adds a log entry, using the ADD/DEL pattern to avoid errors.
// "Captain's log, stardate 2025.249..."
```

## Example: Custom Suffix Workflow (**Engineering** Specifications)

```csharp
// Register a custom suffix for files marked as "archived"
options.SuffixConfiguration.RegisterCustomSuffix("archive", fileName => $"{fileName}_archive_{DateTime.Now:yyyyMMdd}");
```
*You can create custom suffixes for archiving, backups, errors, or any workflow you needâ€”**"I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain!"***

## Example: Checking Health (**Medical** Tricorder)

```csharp
var report = await lcars.RunDiagnosticsAsync();
Console.WriteLine(report.GetLCARSDisplay());
```
*See a colorful statusâ€”green means good, yellow or red means check your files! **"He's dead, Jim... but your files are fine!"***
